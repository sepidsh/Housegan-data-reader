Input Data : [RPLAN dataset](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html), which offers 60k vector-graphics floorplans designed by professional architects. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations based on the three standard metrics (i.e., realism, diversity, and compatibility) in the literature demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the current-state-of-the-art by a large margin.<br/>

How to run
------
  '''python rasetr_to_json.py --path #rplan_dataset/#image_number.png'''

Output data format
------

The data file (e.g., /sample_output/0.json), which could be generated by *predict.lua* (\*_popup.txt), has the following format:

```sample  json
"room_type": [3, 4, 1, 3 ]  # having room type in it

ROOM_CLASS = {"living_room": 1, "kitchen": 2, "bedroom": 3, "bathroom": 4, "balcony": 5, "entrance": 6, "dining room": 7, "study room": 8,
              "storage": 10 , "front door": 15, "unknown": 16, "interior_door": 17}
"boxes: [[72.0, 161.0, 124.0, 220.0], [72.0, 130.0, 107.0, 157.0], [111.0, 28.0, 184.0, 203.0], [72.0, 87.0, 124.0, 126.0]] #bounding boxes per room
  
 "edges":[72.0, 161.0, 72.0, 220.0, 3, 0], ...,[107.0, 130.0, 72.0, 130.0, 4, 0], [148.0, 28.0, 148.0, 87.0, 1, 2]] #First four entry are per list are rooms edges and 4th and 6th are showing what room type is on each side of edge 
 
 "ed_rm":[0], [0], [0], [0, 2], ..., [2], [2, 3], [2, 1], [2, 0], [2]] #room indexes that are on each side of the edges
